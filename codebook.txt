This tidy dataset summarises the data from the following:


The data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The data includes both the train and test data sets.

Only the mean columns "mean()" and standard deviation "Std()" values were used for each type of measurement.

The subjects are numbered 1 to 30.

THe six activities are:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

The data was summarised by activity and subject and a mean() taken of each of the measurements for each.

The measures columns are:
